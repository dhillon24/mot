# Multi-Object Tracking using FairMOT

This is a PyTorch implementation of FairMOT for multi-object tracking. Weights can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QYvMf1ttsfpkZFCRkHrUANCtn54KInGf/view?usp=sharing) 
and should be put in a new models/ directory. detect.py runs FairMOT on sample images in /images and track.py on sample frames in /frames. Tracker data association 
is WIP. Available hyperparameters in train.py, detect.py and detect.py can be explored with --help
